Fork of xkcdAlt https://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/enpodcpdpfdedhkgjdhlbjaknfkcelpp

This extension is NOT limited to xkcd only and shows titles for ALL
images. This allows us to browse other popular comic sites such as
abstrusegoose.com, thedoghousediaries.com, cowbirdsinlove.com. Even
better, this extension listens to DOM events, so it works on AJAX
sites like Google Reader.

All images with titles will have the titles shown in bold under
them. If this changes the page layout badly, you can hover mouse over
that image, to restore the layout for that image. That is, the title
text will removed, and you get the hover-over text, as if nothing happened.

We use two heuristics to avoid breaking sites:
1. Many pages use tiny icons as buttons, and place a title on it to
explain the use. Therefore we only affect images larger than 40x40.
2. Live.com uses a large transparent image to decorate elements and
place titles on it. On the other hand, stand-alone images are usually
unique. We ignore duplicate images.

And as a last defense, we use a blacklist to disable this extension for certain sites.
