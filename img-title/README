Fork of xkcdAlt https://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/enpodcpdpfdedhkgjdhlbjaknfkcelpp

This extension is NOT limited to xkcd only and shows titles for ALL
images. This allows us to browse other popular comic sites such as
abstrusegoose.com, thedoghousediaries.com, cowbirdsinlove.com. Even
better, this extension listens to DOM events, so it works on AJAX
sites like Google Reader.

All images with titles will have the titles shown in bold under
them. If this changes the page layout badly, you can hover mouse over
that image, to restore the layout for that image. That is, the title
text will removed, and you get the hover-over text, as if nothing happened.

Known issues: the inserted text node is given its associated img's src
as id, which is not guaranteed to be unique, but usually is for large images.

Collaboration is welcomed to support user opitons.
