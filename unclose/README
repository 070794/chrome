Fork of https://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/jpiminnjjibejnjmemcmacdgckeeplaf,
with a lot of nice changes:

1. Only record http/https/ftp/file pages.
2. Better support for webpages with special characters in the title.
3. Automatically forgets a tab when it's restored.
4. Tries to remember the tab's position, known to be flawed at this point.
5. Frees up local storage (original version keeps writing to it).
6. Minor UI changes, such as wider popup (500px) and url tooltips.
7. Divide tab history into 20-item pages.
8. Favicons (needs some improvements.)

To get really good favicons, we could
a. Invoke the background page to request for the page, parse it, and retrieve the favicon on our own

b. Call the fast favicon service, and compare the image with the default image.
   If the comparison succeeds, we call the second favicon service.
   Unfortunately, to access the image data, we still need the background page to act as the middle man.
   This can be done by send a xhr and get the raw data, or load the image into a canvas and access it.
   The former can be done similar to the megaupload captcha extension.
   The latter can be done by referring to

Note that tabs created before the installation of this extension will not be monitored.
