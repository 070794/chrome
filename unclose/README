Fork of https://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/jpiminnjjibejnjmemcmacdgckeeplaf,
with a lot of nice changes:

1. Only record http/https/ftp/file pages.
2. Better support for webpages with special characters in the title.
3. Automatically forgets a tab when it's restored.
4. Tries to remember the tab's position, known to be flawed at this point.
5. Frees up local storage (original version keeps writing to it).
6. Minor UI changes, such as wider popup (500px) and url tooltips.
7. Divide tab history into 20-item pages.
8. Favicons

TODO: There's really no reason to use localStorage; an in-memory global object would do fine.

Note that tabs created before the installation of this extension will not be monitored.
